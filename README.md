# Good and bad chatbots

This should serve as an overview of what I perceive as good and bad chatsbots.

## A quick overview

I wanted to add two separate tables next to each other, apparently that only works with inline HTMLðŸ˜….

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

| Good ones |
|---------|
| ChatGPT |
| Github Copilot |

</td>
<td>

| Bad ones |
|---------|
| Tay by Microsoft |
| Colossal Cave Adventure |

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the following section, examplanations of **two** examples will follow:

## ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is probably one of if not the most well known chatbot to date. I list it as good because of two main reasons:

- It's vast functionality to individually respond to literally every text input.
- It's highly qualitative outputs.

Here is an example of the german version:

## Colossal Cave Adventure

I thought about this when thinking about bad examples. However, I'm not quite sure if it actually counts as a *chatbot* in the sense of this course.

Colossal Cave Adventure was one of the first computer games ever. Just leveraging a console for the user to input game-specific prompt in order to progress the game.

Here is an 11 year old playthrough of the game:
