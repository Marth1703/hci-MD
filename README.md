In the following section, explanations of **two** examples will follow:

## ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is probably one of, if not the most well-known chatbot to date. I list it as good because of two main reasons:

- Its vast functionality to individually respond to literally every text input.
- Its highly qualitative outputs.

Here is an example of the German version:

## Colossal Cave Adventure

I thought about this when thinking about bad examples. However, I'm not quite sure if it actually counts as a *chatbot* in the sense of this course.

Colossal Cave Adventure was one of the first computer games ever, just leveraging a console for the user to input game-specific prompts in order to progress the game.

Here is an 11-year-old playthrough of the game:

Since the chat interaction is predefined and only accepts a limited number of inputs, I argue this "chatbot" is bad because of this limitation (despite it being a great innovation for the time it was released).
